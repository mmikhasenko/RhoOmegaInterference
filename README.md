# Rho-Omega Interference in pi pi spectrum

The decay χc1(3872) → J/ψ π⁺ π⁻ occurs via both the ρ, and ω resonances. The signals need to be incorporated coherently in the same wave, at the same time matching low energy $π⁺π⁻$ phase shift.

The repository contains a short write up and the source code.
