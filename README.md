# Rho-Omega Interference in pi pi spectrum

The decay $\chi_{c1}\to J/\psi\to \pi^+\pi^-$ occurs via both the $\rho$, and $\omega$ resonances. The signals need to be incorporated coherently in the same wave,
at the same time matching low energy $\pi\pi$ phase shift.

The repository contains a short write up and the source code.
